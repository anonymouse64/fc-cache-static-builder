# Build static fontconfig fc-cache-v{6,7} based on xenial,bionic

This code will build a static version of fc-cache for cache
version v6 based on the fontconfig source from xenial-security
and for v7 based on the fontconfig source from bionic-security.

The bionic source is patched so that it builds on a 16.04 system.
